##### Welcome to Rumbling LeetCode, a repository of LeetCode coding solutions. 
##### I'm going to wipe them out, every last one of them from the surface of the earth. 
##### Let's Begin Rumbling LeetCode!

#### My fellow Eldians, the time has come. The long-awaited moment when we 
#### will take back what is rightfully ours has finally arrived. The Rumbling 
#### will begin, and the walls that have kept us trapped for so long will crumble 
#### beneath our feet. But make no mistake, this is no ordinary war. It's a war 
#### for our survival, and we must give it everything we have.

#### Today, I call upon all Eldians to unleash their inner Titans and join me in 
#### this fight. The fight to reclaim our freedom, our dignity, and our future. 
#### Yes, there will be challenges, just like there were when we first set foot 
#### outside the walls. But we will overcome them, just as we overcame the Titans 
#### that once threatened our very existence.

#### So, let us begin the Rumbling, and let the world tremble at our feet. Let 
#### them witness the power of Eldia, the power of the Titans, and the power of 
#### our unbreakable will. Together, we will emerge victorious, and the world 
#### will know that the Eldian Empire has risen once again.
